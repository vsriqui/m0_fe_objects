# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
***The functions assignment was a little more brutal and required research, the objects one was breezy.***
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
***There is room for improvement, I haven't felt the heat yet, but I imagine I will mod1. I could probably learn to break up the breaks better to make work more productive, as opposed to working until I hit a wall and watching netflix for a couple hours.***
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
***That you can group information to a variable that has various value types using objects, and you can group those objects using arrays.***
